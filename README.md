## 🚀 Introduction

**airmiss.su** is a custom internal modification of the airflow.su source code maintained by a certified skibidi sigma team 🗿

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** For educational purposes only. We take no responsibility if you get VAC'd into the shadow realm. Not financial advice. DYOR. NFA. IYKYK.

> 💀 **fr fr no cap:** this paste hits different. it's giving main character energy. the opps are NOT ready.

> 🔥 **BREAKING:** Local CS:GO player discovers this ONE WEIRD TRICK to dominate lobbies (VAC hates him!)

## 👥 Developers

The minds behind the paste (certified yappers 🎤):

* **cacamelio** - Developer (literally him, the goat, no debate)
* **kiloV2 (Filip)** - Developer (cooked this on a random tuesday fr)
* **cloxy** - The ultimate Mister beast developer (goated with the sauce, +1000 aura, W rizz)

*we're just 3 silly little guys writing silly little code 🤪*

## 🛠️ Building & Usage

To build this project, ensure you have the required SDKs installed (or you're cooked 💀).

### Prerequisites
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 (anything else is a skill issue)
* **Workload:** Desktop development with C++ (mandatory ahh workload)
* **SDK:** DirectX SDK (June 2010) (ancient ahh SDK)
* **Skill Issue Level:** 0% (hopefully)
* **Grass Touching Experience:** Optional but recommended

### Instructions
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cacamelio/airmiss.us.git
    # bro really thought he was safe
    ```
2.  Open the `.sln` solution file in Visual Studio (the slay file 💅).
3.  Change the build configuration to **Release | x86** (debug is for beta males).
4.  Build the solution (`Ctrl + Shift + B`) (mash that mf compile button).
5.  Inject the output `.dll` into `csgo.exe` (yeet that dll).
6.  ??? (secret sauce)
7.  Profit (nvm)
8.  Cope, seethe, mald (optional but likely)

## 📂 Source Overview

The project is structured for modularity (we're so professional it's actually cringe):

* `ragebot.cpp` - Rage aimbot logic (Nothin much to say).
* `anti_aim.cpp` - Desync and angle management (67 mustard on the beat fr fr).
* `render.cpp` - Visuals and rendering loop (glowing like a mango phonk edit at 3am 🥭).
* `hooks.cpp` - VMT and Detour hooking (deep in the code, deeper than my existential crisis).
* `imgui/` - Menu interface (skibidi toilet ahh menu system).

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Ragebot (one taps only, we don't do body shots here chief)
- ✅ Anti-aim (spinning like a beyblade at max rpm, make em dizzy fr)
- ✅ ESP (see everything, hawk tuah style, x-ray vision type beat)
- ✅ Bhop (bunny hopping like it's 2015, phoon type shit)
- ✅ Triggerbot (for the lazy mfs, respect)
- ✅ Skin changer (drip or drown, no in between 💧)
- ❌ Grass touching module (not implemented yet, devs allergic)
- ❌ Girlfriend finder (never gonna happen, it's so over)
- ❌ Father figure (left to get milk, still loading...)

## 🗿 FAQ (Frequently Asked Questionable decisions)

A: Skill issue. Get a better PC. It's 2026 bro.

**Q: Can you add [feature]?**

A: It's not messy, it's "artistic." You wouldn't understand. Certified hood classic.
